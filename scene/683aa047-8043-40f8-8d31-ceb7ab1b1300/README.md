DONE fix follow item path mirror
DONE fix sync 12 vs 11 - solved the follow path had ended

fix sync reply before response
WIP clean up code
WIP fix add/remove persist parent object
TEST adjustForSceneRotation - need to test with odd shapped parcels

- FIXME need rotate data!? might be in the tween now? TEST in multi player. think i have this synced correctly. line 1438 const { channel: \_, ...tween } = entity.getComponent(TweenableMove)
- DONE need to recurse in for follow/face player and hardcode the values into onCompletes - since each fires off one after other, only need to target oncomlete+1. and it will copy forward on next invoke
- world clock to sync times better?

NEED

DONE refactor
DONE removeAction.clone and do channel.createAction
DONE cache target of integrest so does not lookup each time

REMOVE ATTACH/DETACH as sketchy at the moment when scene rotated. do we care?
REMOVE HIDE/SHOW as sketchy at the moment removes all singleton Shapes

## Builder Bugginess

Builder is running SDK 6.6.3 (not the latest). The latest SDK is 6.6.5. [More on that here](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=72f3d560-d1f4-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2). There are a few things Builder does not do right like rotation. While I try to get workarounds for issues like these please do not think its broke. When deployed on the latest SDK it works correctly

#### Known issues:

- Face Player + Face Item using Mode: Scene Axis does not work correctly. Mode: Item Axis works fine in Builder

## New Features

### New Curve Type: Instantaneous In/Out

Instantly moves,rotates,scales and item. There is no smooth transition from the previous position,rotation,scale to the new one. It shifts immediatly. For the sake of synchronicity any "onComplete" actions that follow will still have the wait XX time period to fire like all the other curve types

### Improved Multiplayer

Syncronious only use be registered to the initiator (the one invoking the action). This meant if the initiator left the scene the scene state could not propagate to new players to the scene. Now all scene members can share scene state

### Improved the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem)

Previously you could execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time. Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out. Added the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time. More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale. Any other action types could continue.

### Improved Animate Action

Added weight + layer

## New Actions

### Face Player

The target item will rotate towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player. The position the item rotates is the position the player was at time of triggering, not where the player moves to afterwards.

### Face Item

The target item will rotate towards the item of interest at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the item. The position the item rotates is the position the item was at time of triggering, not where the item of interest moves to afterwards.

### Move to Item

The target item will move towards the target item at a configurable speed for how fast it moves and stops when at the target item. The position the item moves to is the position the item was at time of triggering, not where the target item moves to afterwards.

### Move to Player

The target item will move towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it move and stops when arrived at the player. The position the item moves is the position the player was at time of triggering, not where the player moves to afterwards.

### Follow Path of Items

The target item will follow a path of defined items. This is like move to item however you list more than one item. It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.

### Scene Add/Remove

Action will let you remove/add an object. Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses. One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.

### Motion Control

Allows a player to pause, stop, resume an action

<img src="../docs/tools-ce/screenshots/motion-control.png" width="150">

## Types

### Speed

Speed is found on many of the actions. Meaning it is how fast or the time it will take for the action to complete. It has a value of 1-20. The existing toolbox had a slider so I kept it for backwards compatibility sake however as the table below shows below it can be limiting. You cannot easily pick values above 3 seconds like 4 or 6,7,8,9 nor can you go above 10. I am considering changing this either to a type your own value or modifying the function of time. Maybe a new field called time scale? As to not be backwards breaking leaving this alone for now. I considered modifying the step increment from 1 to be .5 to give a few more time options but it doubles the possible values and only gains you 2 extra time blocks of "4" and "6" seconds. For backwards compatibility sake leaving it as is for now.

It is a function of `(speed/10)*deltaTime=1`

### Curve Type

Curve (Easing) functions specify the rate of change of a parameter over time.

Objects in real life donâ€™t just start and stop instantly, and almost never move at a constant speed. When we open a drawer, we first move it quickly, and slow it down as it comes out. Drop something on the floor, and it will first accelerate downwards, and then bounce back up after hitting the floor.

Here is an excellant summary of all the curve types.

### Repeat Type

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None      | When the action is done. Do not repeat                                                                                                          |
| Absolute  | When the action is done start over from the position/rotation/scale the item was first in before the action started                             |
| Relative  | When the action is done it will loop the same action again from its current position/rotation/scale and apply it again                          |
| Mirror    | When the action is done it will loop the same action but in reverse. It will start from its end position/rotation/scale and return to its start |

### Target Tracking Type

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current Position    | Will track the item/player based on current position of that item/player when the action is fired. It will be straight path towards this point.                                                          |
| End Action Position | Will track the item/player based its future/end position if that item/player is in motion. If not in motion this has the same effect as "Current Position". It will be straight path towards this point. |
| Follow              | Will track the item/player based on its position at that moment in time. It will auto correct as the tracked item moves. This will produce a curved path                                                 |

## Multiplayer Support

Listed here are modes/params that I have not thoroughly tested for multi player syncability

- Target Tracking Types: Follow. Current Position/En Action Position should be fine
- Scene Add/Remove - while an item is removed from the scene it will not recieve updates to item syncing
